Tapeless Looper for arduino nano

Done with the Mozzi Library: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/

If you want your own loops on it Export the audio to signed 8-bit in raw to later on convert using char2mozzi.py (https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/char2mozzi_8py_source.html). This will turn your sample into a wavetable that your arduino program can handle. Ensure you have python installed with all the options selected to work in comand prompt enviroment.

Attention! The converted must be stored on the generic sample folder inside the mozzi library folder to work good.
